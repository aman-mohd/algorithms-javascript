# Algorithms x Javascript
Author: Mohd Aman | Full-stack Developer | Engineer | Problem Solver

Hi, I began my career as a web developer in 2021. Since then, I've worked on two professional web applications and numerous personal projects. Since my background is in civil engineering, I initially struggled with algorithms. To improve, I've started documenting my learning in this repository. This way, I can track my progress, and others can also benefit from the information in the future.

>Current Skills : Javascript, ReactJS, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, NoSQL, MongoDB, Material UI, HTML5, CSS


## Greedy Method
- Greedy method is a problem-solving strategy used for optimization problems, similar to other strategies like divide and conquer.
- Optimization problems demand either minimum or maximum results.
- Feasible solutions satisfy the constraints of the problem, while optimal solutions achieve either minimum or maximum results.
- Greedy method aims to find an optimal solution by making locally optimal choices at each stage.
- It is particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution can be built incrementally.
- The approach involves solving the problem in stages and selecting inputs that are locally optimal.
- Greedy method is efficient compared to exhaustive methods but may not always yield the globally optimal solution.
- Examples such as choosing the best car or hiring the best candidate illustrate the greedy approach.
- Greedy method allows for quick problem-solving by following known selection methods, even if they are not exhaustive.
- The approach is characterized by adopting predefined selection methods to efficiently solve problems.
